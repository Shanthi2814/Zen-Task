1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1 

i) HyperText Transfer Protocol 1.1 which was created in 1997
ii) It works in textual format.
iii)There is a head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get  its all resources.
iv) It uses request resource Inlining for getting multiple pages.
v) It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2:

i)  HyperText Transfer Protocol 2 which was created in 2015
ii) It works on the binary protocol.
iii) It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
iv) It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
v) It uses HPACK for data compression.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object : 

	In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
1.By object literal
2.By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
object={property1:value1,property2:value2…..propertyN:valueN}
Property and value are separated by colon(:).
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
Var objectname=new Object();
Here, a new keyword is used to create an object.
Accessing JavaScript Objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
objectName.property
Ex:
Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,
              		person.fname
